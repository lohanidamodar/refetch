# Refetch — Mobile & Desktop App

> Open-source alternative to YC-controlled HN, featuring curated tech news,
> discussions, and community-driven content.

The official **Flutter** client for [Refetch](https://refetch.io), bringing the
feed, threads, voting, and notifications to Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, and
Linux on top of the same [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io) backend as the web app.

## Architecture

A **hybrid client** that reuses the existing Refetch backend: **auth** goes
through the Appwrite Dart SDK (sessions + JWT), while **reads and mutations** go
through the `refetch.io` REST API authenticated with that JWT. **Push** uses FCM
on Android and APNS directly on iOS (no Firebase on iOS) via the
[`push`](https://pub.dev/packages/push) plugin.

Built with Flutter, Riverpod, go_router, `http`, and the `appwrite` Dart SDK.

## Getting started

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run            # pick a device, or e.g. flutter run -d windows
```

The feed works out of the box against the Refetch backend. Push notifications
are optional and disabled until configured — see [`backend/`](backend/README.md)
and the topic/provider ids in `lib/core/config/app_config.dart`.

Release signing is read from `android/key.properties` (gitignored); see
`android/key.properties.example`.
